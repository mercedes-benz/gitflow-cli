Gitflow is a [branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) that organizes feature development, 
releases, and hotfixes into dedicated branches, providing a structured approach to managing complex software projects with
reliable releases based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

The **gitflow-cli** automates this release workflow process, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. 
It maintains a clean and consistent Git graph, contributing to overall project stability.

## Installation

From within the project directory the **gitflow-cli** can be built, run and installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mercedes-benz/gitflow-cli.git
    cd gitflow-cli
    ```

2. **Install the application:**

   To install and run the application, use the following commands:

   ```bash
   go install
   gitflow-cli --help
   ```

   **Note:** Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed and that the `go/bin` directory is part of your PATH.

## Usage

Before using **gitflow-cli**, either navigate to your target Git repository or specify it with the `--path` flag.
Make sure the repository meets all [preconditions](#preconditions).

### Release

To initiate a new release, use the following command:

   ```bash
   gitflow-cli release start
   ```

Release start will perform the following steps:

* Create a new release branch from `develop` (e.g., `release/1.2.0`)
* Remove the version qualifier in the version file (e.g., `1.2.0-dev` → `1.2.0`)

You can now use the `release/x.y.z` branch for bug fixing, creating the release changelog, or deploying your app to your testing environment.

Once the release is ready, finish it with:

   ```bash
   gitflow-cli release finish
   ```

Release finish will perform the following steps:
* Merge the `release/x.y.z` branch into `main` (e.g., `release/1.2.0` → `main`)
* Create a tag in `main` with the corresponding version (e.g., `v1.2.0`)
* Perform a back-merge into `develop` (e.g., `release/1.2.0` → `develop`)
* Bump the development version to the next minor version (e.g., `1.3.0-dev`)

### Hotfix

Use hotfixes if you have a bug in production, and you need to make targeted fixes to `main` branch without deploying pending changes from `develop`.

To initiate a new hotfix, use the following command:

   ```bash
   gitflow-cli hotfix start
   ```

Hotfix start will perform the following steps:
* Create a `hotfix/x.y.z` branch from `main` (e.g., `hotfix/1.2.1`)
* Set the patch version in the version file (e.g., `1.2.0` → `1.2.1`)

You can now check out the `hotfix/x.y.z` branch, create a quick patch, and push your changes.

Once the hotfix is ready, finish it with:

   ```bash
   gitflow-cli hotfix finish
   ```

Hotfix finish will perform the following steps:
* Merge the `hotfix/x.y.z` branch into `main` (e.g., `hotfix/1.2.1` → `main`)
* Create a tag in `main` with the corresponding version (e.g., `v1.2.1`)
* Perform a back-merge into `develop` (e.g., `hotfix/1.2.1` → `develop`)
* Keep the current version in `develop` unchanged (e.g., `1.3.0-dev`)

## Preconditions

To use **gitflow-cli**, ensure your project meets the basic structural requirements, particularly around Git branches and version management.

### Git Branches

Your repository must define a dedicated **production** and **development** branches (e.g., `main` and `develop`).
These can be [customized](#configuration) as needed.

### Version File

Each project type may store version information in a different location.
The **gitflow-cli** detects your project's context and automatically delegates tasks to the appropriate plugin based on the presence of specific file.

#### Available Plugins

| Plugin       | Description                                                | Required File  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **standard** | Plugin for projects without a predefined technology stack. | `version.txt`  |
| **mvn**      | Plugin for [maven](https://maven.apache.org) projects.     | `pom.xml`      |
| **npm**      | Plugin for [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) projects.         | `package.json` |
| **road**     | Plugin for projects with road app manifest configuration.  | `road.yaml`    |
| **composer** | Plugin for [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) projects.  | `composer.json`|

**Note:** If no technology-specific plugin can be applied, **gitflow-cli** will create a `version.txt` file in your project's root directory and apply the **standard** plugin.

## Configuration

   You have the option to provide a configuration file to **gitflow-cli**.
   This configuration file will be automatically located at `HOME/.gitflow-cli.yaml` and has the following structure:

   ```yaml
   core:
     production: main | custom-name                        # production branch name
     development: develop | custom-name                    # development branch name
     release: release | custom-name                        # release branch prefix
     hotfix: hotfix | custom-name                          # hotfix branch prefix
     undo: true | false                                    # rollback local changes in case of an error, default = false
     logging: stderr | stdout | cmdline | output | off     # diagnostic logging for the Gitflow workflow, default = stdout | cmdline | output
   ```

   You can also specify a custom configuration file using the top-level flag `--config file-path`.
